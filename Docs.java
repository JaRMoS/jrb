/**
 * @defgroup jrb JRB
 * @short Package for simulation of rbmatlab models.
 *
 * \note This module depends on \ref jarmosbase.
 * 
 * This package is an extension/cleanup/rewrite of all the classes previously contained in the @ref rbappmit android
 * application, see http://augustine.mit.edu/methodology/methodology_rbAPPmit_Client_Software.htm.
 * Even though basically everything has been structured and streamlined, the original work has been an
 * invaluable starting point in order to get grips on both Java RB simulations and android application development.
 * Hence, we owe a big thanks to David J. Knezevic and Phuong Huynh (MIT at that time) for the initial programming and
 * their agreement to use and improve the existing program.
 * 
 * Most of the included models stem from the old @ref rbappmit package, which is why there is an old model type "rbappmit"
 * for compatibility and a new type "JRB" which is to use for newly included models.
 * Check out the @ref jarmos_models section for details on how to include new models.
 * 
 * Check out the rbmatlab release on http://www.morepas.org/software/ for more information on how to generate and export
 * rbmatlab models to JaRMoS.
